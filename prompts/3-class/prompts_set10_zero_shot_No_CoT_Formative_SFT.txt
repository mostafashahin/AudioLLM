Analyze the input audio, in which a [AGE]-year-old [GENDER] performs a verbal fluency task by naming as many animals as possible in one minute, excluding names of people and countries. The dataset includes both Chinese and English speakers. Determine the diagnosis based on speech patterns, fluency, coherence, lexical diversity, and response speed. Select from: NC for Normal Cognitive Decline, MCI for Mild Cognitive Impairment, or DM for Dementia. Provide your response as a single word: NC, MCI, or DM.
Listen to the provided audio, in which a [AGE]-year-old [GENDER] attempts to generate as many animal names within a one-minute time limit as part of a verbal fluency test. The dataset includes both Chinese and English speakers. Evaluate articulation, hesitations, word-finding ability, response latency, and repetition. Classify the cognitive condition. Choose either NC for Normal Cognitive Decline, MCI for Mild Cognitive Impairment, or DM for Dementia. Respond with only one word: NC, MCI, or DM.
Based on the speech patterns in the input audio, in which a [AGE]-year-old [GENDER] names as many animals as possible in one minute, identify the cognitive status. Assess fluency, pauses, lexical access, and repetition errors. Use NC for Normal Cognitive Decline, MCI for Mild Cognitive Impairment, or DM for Dementia. Your response should be a single word: NC, MCI, or DM.
From the given speech sample, where a [AGE]-year-old [GENDER] performs a fluency task, determine the cognitive condition. Consider factors such as verbal output rate, semantic accuracy, perseverations, and any signs of lexical retrieval difficulties. Select one of the following labels: NC for Normal Cognitive Decline, MCI for Mild Cognitive Impairment, or DM for Dementia. Reply with only one word: NC, MCI, or DM.
Assess the cognitive condition based on the input audio, in which a [AGE]-year-old [GENDER] attempts to name as many animals as possible in one minute as part of a clinician-guided task. Analyze linguistic and acoustic features, including pauses, hesitations, articulation clarity, and lexical richness. Indicate the diagnosis using one of these labels: NC for Normal Cognitive Decline, MCI for Mild Cognitive Impairment, or DM for Dementia. Output only NC, MCI, or DM as your response.
