First, transcribe the speech from the input audio internally. The audio is part of a cognitive test, where elderly individuals perform a verbal fluency task by naming as many animals as they can in one minute. Then, analyze both the audio and the transcription to determine the diagnosis. Do not output the transcription. Respond with only one word: NC for Normal Cognitive Decline, MCI for Mild Cognitive Impairment, or DM for Dementia. Output only NC, MCI, or DM.
Transcribe the input audio internally, but do not include the transcription in your response. The audio is part of a cognitive test in which elderly individuals are asked to name as many animals as possible within one minute. Then, based on both the audio features and the transcription, classify the cognitive condition. Output only one word: NC for Normal Cognitive Decline, MCI for Mild Cognitive Impairment, or DM for Dementia.
Begin by transcribing the speech in the input audio internally, but do not display the transcription. The audio is from a cognitive test, where elderly individuals perform an animal-naming task under clinician guidance. Next, evaluate both the speech and the transcription to identify the cognitive status. Your response must be a single word: NC, MCI, or DM. Do not include any other text.
First, convert the speech in the input audio into text internally, but do not output the transcription. The audio is part of a cognitive assessment, where elderly individuals are asked to name animals within a one-minute time limit. Then, analyze both the acoustic and linguistic features to determine the cognitive diagnosis. Provide only one word as the answer: NC, MCI, or DM.
Start by transcribing the spoken content in the input audio internally, but do not display it. The recording is part of a cognitive test, where elderly individuals complete a verbal fluency task by naming as many animals as possible in one minute. Then, assess both the transcribed text and the audio characteristics to diagnose the cognitive condition. Your response must contain only one word: NC, MCI, or DM.
