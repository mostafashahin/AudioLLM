First, transcribe the speech from the input audio. Then, identify what the speaker is describing based on the transcription. Consider whether the description is clear, detailed, and coherent. Next, analyze both the audio and the transcription, taking into account fluency, word choice, pauses, and pronunciation patterns. Finally, determine the diagnosis. Choose from: NC for Normal Cognitive Decline or MCI for Mild Cognitive Impairment. Provide your response as a single word: NC or MCI.
Transcribe the input audio first. Then, determine what the speaker is describing—an object, a scene, or an event—based on the transcription. Evaluate the clarity and completeness of the description. Next, analyze both the acoustic and linguistic aspects of the speech, including pronunciation, hesitations, repetition, and structural complexity. Finally, classify the cognitive condition. Select one: NC for Normal Cognitive Decline or MCI for Mild Cognitive Impairment. Respond with only one word: NC or MCI.
Begin by generating a transcription of the speech in the input audio. Then, extract the key elements of the description: What is the speaker trying to describe? Assess whether the description is logically structured and whether important details are missing or confused. Next, evaluate both the speech and the transcription for articulation, fluency, and coherence. Based on this assessment, identify the cognitive status. Choose either NC for Normal Cognitive Decline or MCI for Mild Cognitive Impairment. Reply with a single word: NC or MCI.
First, convert the speech in the input audio into text. Then, determine what the speaker is describing—whether it is a person, object, or event in an image. Assess how well the description aligns with typical responses, noting any signs of confusion, word-finding difficulties, or omissions. Next, analyze both the acoustic and linguistic features, including speech fluency, pauses, and coherence. Finally, determine the cognitive diagnosis. Select one: NC for Normal Cognitive Decline or MCI for Mild Cognitive Impairment. Provide your answer as a single word: NC or MCI.
Start by transcribing the spoken content in the input audio. Then, extract key details about what the speaker is describing—does the response provide a complete and logical depiction of the image? Consider whether there are missing elements, repetitive phrasing, or unusual word choices. Next, assess both the transcribed text and the audio characteristics, analyzing pronunciation, fluency, and articulation. Finally, diagnose the cognitive condition. Choose between NC for Normal Cognitive Decline or MCI for Mild Cognitive Impairment. Respond with only NC or MCI.
