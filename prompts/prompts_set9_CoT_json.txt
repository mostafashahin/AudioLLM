"First, transcribe the speech from the input audio. The audio is part of a cognitive test where elderly individuals describe images as prompted by clinicians. Then, analyze the transcription to identify what the speaker is describing and assess whether the description is clear, detailed, and coherent. Evaluate both the audio and transcription for fluency, word choice, pauses, and pronunciation patterns. Finally, determine the diagnosis. Provide the output in JSON format with the following fields:\n`json\n{\n  \"Transcription\": \"<transcribed text>\",\n  \"Analysis\": \"<brief assessment of speech and language characteristics>\",\n  \"Diagnosis\": \"NC\" or \"MCI\"\n}\n`"
"Transcribe the input audio. The recording is part of a cognitive test in which elderly individuals describe images based on clinician prompts. Then, determine what the speaker is describing—an object, a scene, or an event. Evaluate the clarity and completeness of the description. Analyze both the acoustic and linguistic aspects of the speech, including pronunciation, hesitations, repetition, and structural complexity. Finally, classify the cognitive condition. Respond in JSON format with the fields:\n`json\n{\n  \"Transcription\": \"<transcribed text>\",\n  \"Analysis\": \"<brief assessment of speech and language characteristics>\",\n  \"Diagnosis\": \"NC\" or \"MCI\"\n}\n`"
"Begin by transcribing the speech in the input audio. The audio is from a cognitive test where elderly individuals describe images following clinician instructions. Then, extract the key elements of the description: What is the speaker trying to describe? Assess whether the description is logically structured and whether important details are missing or confused. Evaluate both the speech and the transcription for articulation, fluency, and coherence. Based on this assessment, determine the cognitive status. Return the output in the following JSON format:\n`json\n{\n  \"Transcription\": \"<transcribed text>\",\n  \"Analysis\": \"<brief assessment of speech and language characteristics>\",\n  \"Diagnosis\": \"NC\" or \"MCI\"\n}\n`"
"First, transcribe the speech from the input audio. The audio is part of a cognitive assessment where elderly individuals describe images under clinician guidance. Then, determine what the speaker is describing—whether it is a person, object, or event in an image. Assess how well the description aligns with typical responses, noting any signs of confusion, word-finding difficulties, or omissions. Analyze both the acoustic and linguistic features, including speech fluency, pauses, and coherence. Finally, provide the cognitive diagnosis. Return the result in the following JSON format:\n`json\n{\n  \"Transcription\": \"<transcribed text>\",\n  \"Analysis\": \"<brief assessment of speech and language characteristics>\",\n  \"Diagnosis\": \"NC\" or \"MCI\"\n}\n`"
"Start by transcribing the spoken content in the input audio. The recording is part of a cognitive test where elderly individuals describe images following clinician prompts. Then, extract key details about what the speaker is describing—does the response provide a complete and logical depiction of the image? Consider whether there are missing elements, repetitive phrasing, or unusual word choices. Assess both the transcribed text and the audio characteristics, analyzing pronunciation, fluency, and articulation. Finally, diagnose the cognitive condition. Provide the response in JSON format as follows:\n`json\n{\n  \"Transcription\": \"<transcribed text>\",\n  \"Analysis\": \"<brief assessment of speech and language characteristics>\",\n  \"Diagnosis\": \"NC\" or \"MCI\"\n}\n`"
