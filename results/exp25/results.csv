Then, extract the key elements of the description: What is the speaker trying to describe? Assess whether the description is logically structured and whether important details are missing or confused. Evaluate both the speech and the transcription for articulation, fluency, and coherence. Based on this assessment, determine the cognitive status.

Then, determine what the speaker is describing—whether it is a person, object, or event in an image. Assess how well the description aligns with typical responses, noting any signs of confusion, word-finding difficulties, or omissions. Analyze both the acoustic and linguistic features, including speech fluency, pauses, and coherence. Finally, provide the cognitive diagnosis.
