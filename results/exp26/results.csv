Then, analyze the transcription to identify what the speaker is describing and assess whether the description is clear, detailed, and coherent. Evaluate both the audio and transcription for fluency, word choice, pauses, and pronunciation patterns. Finally, determine the diagnosis.

Then, determine what the speaker is describing—whether it is a person, object, or event in an image. Assess how well the description aligns with typical responses, noting any signs of confusion, word-finding difficulties, or omissions. Analyze both the acoustic and linguistic features, including speech fluency, pauses, and coherence. Finally, provide the cognitive diagnosis.
