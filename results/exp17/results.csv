2,"Begin by generating a transcription of the speech in the input audio. Then, extract the key elements of the description: What is the speaker trying to describe? Assess whether the description is logically structured and whether important details are missing or confused. Next, evaluate both the speech and the transcription for articulation, fluency, and coherence. Based on this assessment, identify the cognitive status.
